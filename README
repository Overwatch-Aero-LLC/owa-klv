Currently running locally it just json dumps in console, this is just a test to learn how to make lambda functions triggered by events.

TODO: configure for deployment and have output saved in a bucket that can then be appended to.

# OWA-KLV Project Setup

This document outlines the steps to set up and run the OWA-KLV project locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd owa-klv
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    . .venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
    source .venv/bin/activate # On macOS and Linux
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (if any are listed in a `requirements.txt` file):**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Building the Project

Use the AWS SAM CLI to build the project:
